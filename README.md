# SoundChan: The Discord Voice Bot

## How to Run

Currently the only way to run Sound Chan is to build the bot from source. As such you'll need the JRE and JDK.

## Instructions For Use

To run the sound bot on your Server, you'll need a developer's bot token from Discord. Full instructions for use will be coming, but in the meantime for development purposes, place your token and the corresponding settings in a file named, `soundchan.properties`. You can see an example of how the file should be formatted in `soundchan.properties.example`.
